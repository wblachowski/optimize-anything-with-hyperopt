# Optimize anything with hyperopt

This repository contains source code for a blog post published on the Wunderman Thompson Technology blog.

It contains two directories with code for two distinct usages of hyperopt:
- `ocr` - optimizing OCR preprocessing,
- `sklearn` - automatic model and hyperparameters selection for scikit-learn estimators.
